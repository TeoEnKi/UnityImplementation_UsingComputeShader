The Vec X, Vec Y and Vec Z are box size dimensions

Pressing the enable ball button disables the camera movement and enables ball visibility and movement and vise versa

Some values cannot be changed and updated to the particles mid gameplay, they'll have to be changed before running.

Number of paticles to be made MUST be divisible by 50 due to the multi-threading

Do not over-add number of particles as performance may drop
